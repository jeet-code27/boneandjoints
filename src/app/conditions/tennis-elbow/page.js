                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Tennis elbow, medically known as lateral epicondylitis, is a painful condition that occurs when the tendons in your elbow are overloaded, usually by repetitive motions of the wrist and arm. Despite its name, athletes aren't the only people who develop tennis elbow. Anyone whose activities involve repetitive wrist and arm motions can develop this painful condition, including plumbers, painters, carpenters, and butchers.

                  The Surgical Experience
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Tennis elbow surgery is typically performed as an outpatient procedure, meaning you can go home the same day. The procedure is usually carried out under regional anesthesia (numbing just the arm) or sometimes with general anesthesia.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  For arthroscopic surgery, Dr. Saxena makes several small incisions around the elbow. Through these portals, a camera and specialized instruments are inserted to identify and remove damaged tissue. The procedure typically takes 30-60 minutes.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  After surgery, your arm will be bandaged and possibly placed in a splint temporarily. Pain management protocols, including appropriate medications, help ensure comfort during the initial recovery period. Most patients can return home within a few hours after the procedure.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Recovery from tennis elbow treatment varies depending on the severity of the condition and the type of treatment received:

                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Initial Recovery (0-2 weeks):</span> Rest, ice, protection of the surgical site, and limited activities. A splint may be used briefly.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Early Rehabilitation (2-6 weeks):</span> Gentle range of motion exercises begin, with gradual progression to light strengthening as healing progresses.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Strengthening Phase (6-12 weeks):</span> Progressive resistance exercises targeting the wrist extensors and forearm muscles.</li>
