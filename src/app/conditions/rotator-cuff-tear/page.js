                  What is a Rotator Cuff Tear?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles and their tendons that surround the shoulder joint, keeping the head of the upper arm bone (humerus) firmly within the shallow socket of the shoulder (glenoid). These muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) work together to provide stability and allow a wide range of motion. A rotator cuff tear occurs when one or more of these tendons is torn, either partially or completely, reducing the ability to move the arm properly and often causing significant pain.

                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Partial Tear:</span> The tendon is damaged but not completely severed.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Full-Thickness Tear:</span> A complete tear that creates a hole through the tendon, separating it from the bone.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Acute Tear:</span> Occurs suddenly, typically from an injury or trauma.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Chronic Tear:</span> Develops slowly over time due to degeneration or repetitive stress.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Massive Tear:</span> Involves two or more tendons and may be more challenging to repair.</li>

                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Age-Related Degeneration:</span> Most common in individuals over 40, as tendons naturally wear down over time.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Acute Injury:</span> Falling on an outstretched arm, lifting something heavy with a jerking motion, or direct trauma to the shoulder.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Repetitive Overhead Activities:</span> Common in painters, carpenters, athletes (particularly swimmers, baseball players, and tennis players), and others who repeatedly use their arms overhead.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Reduced Blood Supply:</span> The area where the rotator cuff attaches to the bone naturally has less blood flow, slowing healing and making it more vulnerable to degeneration.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Bone Spurs:</span> Overgrowth of bone can rub against tendons, causing wear and eventual tearing.</li>

                  The Surgical Experience
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Most rotator cuff repairs are performed arthroscopically on an outpatient basis. The procedure is typically carried out under general anesthesia, often combined with a regional nerve block for postoperative pain control.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  During arthroscopic repair, Dr. Saxena makes several small incisions (portals) around the shoulder. Through these portals, a camera and specialized instruments are inserted to remove damaged tissue, prepare the bone surface, and secure the tendon back to the bone using anchors and sutures. The procedure typically takes 1-2 hours, depending on the complexity of the tear and any associated procedures needed.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  Patients usually go home the same day with their arm in a specialized sling or immobilizer to protect the repair. Pain management protocols, including multimodal medications and sometimes continuous cooling devices, help ensure comfort during the initial recovery period.

                  Recovery and Rehabilitation
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Recovery from rotator cuff repair is a gradual process that typically follows this timeline:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Protection Phase (0-6 weeks):</span> The arm is kept in a sling to protect the repair. Passive motion exercises may begin soon after surgery under the guidance of a physical therapist, but active movement of the shoulder is restricted.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Early Healing Phase (6-12 weeks):</span> The sling is gradually discontinued, and active-assisted range of motion exercises begin. Light activities of daily living are introduced, but lifting is still limited.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Strengthening Phase (3-4 months):</span> Progressive strengthening exercises for the rotator cuff and surrounding muscles begin. Functional activities are gradually reintroduced.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Return to Activity Phase (4-6 months):</span> Sport-specific or occupation-specific rehabilitation with a gradual return to full activities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                  Dr. Saxena and his team provide a customized rehabilitation protocol for each patient, with regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress. The exact timeline can vary based on the size of the tear, quality of tissue, type of repair, and individual healing rates. Complete recovery and maximum improvement may take 6-12 months.

                  Outcomes and Success Rates
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Modern rotator cuff repair techniques have good to excellent outcomes in the majority of patients:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                  <li>85-95% of patients experience significant pain relief</li>
                  <li>Most patients regain functional range of motion and strength</li>
                  <li>Return to previous activities is possible for most patients, though some high-demand activities may need modification</li>
                  <li>Structural healing rates vary (70-90%) depending on tear size, patient age, tissue quality, and compliance with rehabilitation</li>
                  <li>Even in cases where complete healing doesn't occur, many patients still experience substantial pain relief and functional improvement</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                  Factors that influence outcomes include patient age, tear size, tissue quality, smoking status, diabetes, timing of surgery, and adherence to postoperative protocols. Dr. Saxena takes all these factors into account when developing treatment recommendations and setting realistic expectations.

                  While not all rotator cuff tears can be prevented, especially those related to aging, several strategies may reduce risk:
