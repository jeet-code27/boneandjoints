                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Golfer's elbow, medically known as medial epicondylitis, is a condition that causes pain where the tendons of your forearm muscles attach to the bony bump on the inside of your elbow. The pain might spread into your forearm and wrist. Despite its name, this condition isn't limited to golfers. Any activity that involves repetitive wrist, hand, or forearm movement can lead to golfer's elbow, including throwing sports, racket sports, weight training, and various occupational activities.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Golfer's elbow surgery is typically performed as an outpatient procedure, allowing you to return home the same day. The procedure is usually performed under regional anesthesia (which numbs just the arm) or sometimes with general anesthesia.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  For minimally invasive surgery, Dr. Saxena makes small incisions around the elbow. Using specialized instruments, he identifies and removes the damaged tendon tissue, sometimes releasing or repairing the tendon attachment. The procedure typically takes 30-60 minutes.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  After surgery, your arm will be bandaged and might be placed in a splint temporarily. A comprehensive pain management plan will be in place to ensure your comfort during the initial recovery period. Most patients can return home within a few hours after the procedure with specific aftercare instructions.

                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Progressive Strengthening (6-12 weeks):</span> More intensive strengthening of the forearm flexor muscles and grip, with gradual reintroduction of functional activities.</li>

                  Dr. Saxena and his team provide a customized rehabilitation protocol for each patient, with regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress. Complete recovery may take 4-6 months, though many patients notice significant improvement in symptoms within the first 6-12 weeks.
