                  What is Shoulder Replacement Surgery?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Shoulder replacement surgery (shoulder arthroplasty) involves replacing damaged parts of the shoulder joint with prosthetic components. The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint where the head of the humerus (upper arm bone) fits into a shallow socket in the scapula (shoulder blade). During replacement surgery, the damaged humeral head is replaced with a metal ball attached to a stem, while the socket may be resurfaced with a plastic or metal and plastic component. This procedure is typically performed to relieve pain and restore function in shoulders damaged by various forms of arthritis, severe fractures, or other degenerative conditions.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Shoulder replacement surgery typically takes 2-3 hours and is performed under general anesthesia, often combined with a regional nerve block for postoperative pain control. Most patients require a hospital stay of 1-2 days.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  During the procedure, Dr. Saxena makes an incision (typically 4-6 inches) at the front of the shoulder to access the joint. After carefully protecting surrounding nerves and blood vessels, the damaged bone surfaces are prepared, and the appropriate prosthetic components are precisely positioned. The incision is closed with sutures, and a sterile dressing is applied.

                  <li><span className="font-semibold">Early Recovery (6-12 weeks):</span> Progressive transition to active motion exercises as healing progresses. The sling is gradually discontinued, and strengthening exercises are introduced.</li>

                  Modern shoulder replacement surgery has an excellent track record of success. Most patients can expect:

                  After recovery, most patients can comfortably perform daily activities such as dressing, grooming, and household tasks. While high-impact activities and heavy lifting are generally discouraged to protect the implant, many patients can enjoy swimming, golf, doubles tennis, and other low-impact recreational activities.
